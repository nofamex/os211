## Top 10 List of Week 07

### 1. [C Process Synchronization](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-synchronization-in-c-cplusplus)<br>

this website give use explanation about the synchronization in C
programming languange, mostly it will connect synchronization to
multihtreading.

### 2. [C POSIX Semaphore](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/use-posix-semaphores-c/)<br>

In the presentation pdf we learn about semaphore and stuff, so i was
wondering how to implement it, and stumble across posix.

### 3. [C Mutex Lock in Linux](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/05/c-mutex-examples/)<br>

In threads we can terminate a thread and know what signal does that
thread give so we could identify it. and to achieve thread synchronization
is easily using mutex.

### 4. [Lock and Wait Synchronization in C](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15095/Lock-Wait-Synchronization-in-C)<br>

We know that in multithreading a thread must wait to use a process
a process that currenly being use by other thread, so here i was
wondering whats the best practices for it and found this site.

### 5. [Peterson Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/petersons-algorithm-for-mutual-exclusion-set-1/)<br>

We know in our learning module we learn about peterson, and i still
dont understand much about peterson, and i was googling it and this
webiste give good understanding and example.

### 6. [C semaphore example](https://riptutorial.com/c/example/31715/semaphores)<br>

Its different than the posix one that is included also in this page,
this particular website give more example so i can uderstand it easily.

### 7. [Deadlock Example in C#](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/deadlock-in-csharp/)<br>

Previously i already know whats the concept behind deadlock, and now
i was wondering how to implement it in a real life software and achieve
good concept of multithreading.

### 8. [Prevent Threads From Starvation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15910759/how-to-prevent-threads-from-starvation-in-c11)<br>

We know that starvation is within the same learning concept with deadlock, so
this website give understanding of how to manage the problem coming out from
mutex such as starvation.

### 9. [Error Handling in Multithreading App](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22700123/error-handling-in-a-multi-threaded-application)<br>

Like shown in previous list, we know thats is bunch of problem coming from
multihreading, so i was wondering is there any error handling when a problem
come from threading.

### 10. [Maximum Number of Thread](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/maximum-number-of-threads-that-can-be-created-within-a-process-in-c)<br>

I was wondering about threading, and coming with a question of how
many threads can i created in an app, then this website explain it.
