## Top 10 List of Week 06

### 1. [Multi Threading in C](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/multithreading-in-c)<br>

tthis website give me more information and specify about
multi threading especially in c, because i still cant understand
the concept from the lecture.

### 2. [PID data type](https://www.includehelp.com/c/process-identification-pid_t-data-type.aspx)<br>

as mention in the lecture page, the method getPid(), so i search more
about it and found out that pid is indeed a data type.

### 3. [Single Thread vs Multi Thread](https://samknows.one/hc/en-gb/articles/115003164305-What-is-the-difference-between-Single-and-Multi-Thread-)<br>

as some programming languange support multi thread and some of them
is a single thread languange, i was wondering what make them so difference
rather than just their processing.

### 4. [Multi Threading in Java](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_multithreading.htm)<br>

as java naturally is a multithreaded programming languange, i was
wondering how java impllement multihtread, in fact it is very
different than C.

### 5. [Concurrent Programming](https://www.toptal.com/software/introduction-to-concurrent-programming)<br>

as the concept of a prograaming languange to handle multiple task
i came accros concurrent programming and trying to find out its different
than other paradigm of programming.

### 6. [Pararel Programming](https://hpc.llnl.gov/training/tutorials/introduction-parallel-computing-tutorial)<br>

when i was reading cocncurrent programming, people tent to mention about
pararel programming as well, so im here to find out and learn more, though
it was the same as multithreaded programming.

### 7. [Is Multithreaded Faster](https://www.quora.com/Does-a-multithreaded-program-run-faster-than-a-program-with-just-a-single-thread?share=1)<br>

so i was wondering, because multithreaded can process multiple process
at a time and divide them, does it make them faster then the regular
processing methods.

### 8. [Parent and Child Process](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-vs-parent-process-vs-child-process)<br>

as in fork() method we can specify which is parent and child process,
so i was wondering if what truly is both parent and child process is.

### 9. [Multithreading in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-in-operating-system/)<br>

as an operating system must have multiple process running in the background
as daemon, i want to find out how does the operating system handled the multithreading
is it the same as programming languange or not.

### 10. [How Daemon Works](https://www.hackingtruth.in/2020/02/what-is-daemon-and-how-is-it-work.html)<br>

I am curious as this question pop up in our last quiz, and i try to find out
what really is a dameon.
